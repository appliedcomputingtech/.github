## Our Mission 🚀

Applied Computing; our vision is to deliver sustainable abundance for a growing planet, through AI that works for the Energy Industry.
These industries are an enduring necessity, they power our planet, but their complexity has kept them tethered to legacy systems. These critical industries utilise less than 10% of their data for decision making and process optimisation.
Our flagship product, Orbital, is a Multi-Foundation AI system that enables these industries to finally trust AI in the control room, harness 100% of their data and optimise in real time for any metric unlocking faster decisions, safer operations, and higher performance.
With Orbital, we aim to transform how engineers and operators understand, and optimise their plants using trustworthy, physics-grounded AI.
This isn’t the future of Industrial AI, this is the first time it’s worked.

## Our Approach 🔎

- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Applied AI for Energy Opeations
- **Real-time Optimisation:** Continuous adaptation to changing dynamic conditions
- **Data Integration:** Unifying diverse and multi-dimensional process data sources
- **Predictive Analytics:** Anticipating and preventing process inefficiencies

## Our Impact 💡

- Enhanced Operational Efficiency
- Reduced Downtime and Maintenance Costs
- Improved Product Quality and Yield
- Decreased Environmental Footprint

## Join Us 🤝

We welcome researchers, developers, engineers, and industry partners to join our mission! Whether you're contributing code, sharing expertise, or implementing solutions, help us revolutionise Process Engineering R&D and make applied AI in heavy industry accessible to all. Together, we'll lead the way in AI-driven optimization for a more efficient and sustainable future.
