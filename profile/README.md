## Our Mission ðŸš€

AI has permeated our lives in ways we couldn't even imagine a decade ago. From large language models (LLMs), image generation and personalised recommendations, AI's accomplishments in the tech sector are undeniable. AI innovation is dominated by a small group of tech companies, where the landscape comprises of models produced for mostly general internet use, forming an "AI Oligopoly". This is reflected in models uploaded and used at the worldâ€™s most popular model hubs such as HuggingFace and PyTorch we found 95% of models are for general internet use (natural images and natural text), 3% are for social media networking graphs, and the remaining 2% are for time series use. Industrial sectors, however, lack representation in these hubs, with virtually no models dedicated to their specific needs, hindered by challenges like data privacy and outdated infrastructure.

**We want to bridge this gap, by being the new hub for delivery narrow, adaptable and scalable AI for industry**

## Our research Focus ðŸ”¥
The barriers before us are formidable, but not insurmountable. By crafting a stack of AI tools tailored to meet the specific needs of these industries, I believe we can break down these barriers:
1. **Federated Learning**: To deploy models on a decentralised network of IoT sensors and share insights across models without compromising privacy
2. **Meta Learning**: Hyper-specialised models purpose-built for industrial applications
3. **Compression and Low Rand Adaptation**: to train and optimise models with minimal communication overhead
4. **Generative AI**: For self-supervised representation Learning to overcome data heteroginiety of real-world data distribution
5. **Reinforcement Learning**: for continuous feedback and optimisation

By leveraging this stack, we can navigate the challenges of data privacy, legacy systems, and continuous adaptation. This is the key to unlocking a new era of industrial AI that will be world-altering in its impact and performance.

## Who are we? ðŸ¤˜

We are researchers and engineers from academia and the energy sector, united by our goal to advance narrow AI for industrial usecase and our day-to-day lives through innovative research and practical solutions. 

**Interested in what we do? Get in touch ðŸ¤™**
Let us come together, with our shared passion for AI and its potential, to channel our energies into creating AI solutions that can revolutionise core industries that are crucial to the lives of billions. This is our opportunity to leave an indelible mark on the world and to shape a future where AI's potential is fully realised, and its benefits extend to all sectors of our economy.

Let's make history.
